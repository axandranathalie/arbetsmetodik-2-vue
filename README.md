# Todo App 📝

This project is a simple todo application built with Vue to learn the basics of the Vue framework. In the app, users can add tasks to a list and mark them as "done". When a task is marked as completed, it is crossed out to visually indicate it has been finished. ✅

## Code Quality 🏅
In this project, I've used ESLint and Prettier to ensure consistent code style and avoid common coding issues:

- ESLint helps identify problems in the code that could affect functionality and readability.
- Prettier formats the code to maintain consistent styling and improve readability.
